The function groupAnagrams(strs) is created, where strs is the input list of words or phrases.
A Map is used to store the sorted versions of the words/phrases as keys, and the corresponding anagram groups as values.
A loop is used to iterate through each word or phrase in the input list (strs).
Inside the loop, spaces are removed from each word/phrase and it is converted to lowercase to ensure correct comparison.
The cleaned-up string is split into individual characters, sorted alphabetically, and then joined back together to form a sorted string.
The sorted string is used as the key in the Map.
A check is made to see if the sorted string is already a key in the Map:
If it is not, a new key is created, and an empty array is initialized for it.
If it is already present, the original word/phrase is added to the existing anagram group.
Finally, the values (anagram groups) from the Map are returned as an array.
